This is the files used for creating the 64-bit Live USB sticks for D3D Workshops.
See documentation of wiki: opensourceecology.org/wiki/D3D_Live_ISO

The main chunk of work has been done by the Porteus community, see porteus.org

Only xzm-packages in the modules folder and optional folder as well as some cheatcodes set in boot/syslinux/porteus.cfg have been added to fit the D3D Project.
